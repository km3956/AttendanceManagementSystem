This project was designed as a scalable, user-friendly solution that allowed teachers to manage student attendance through a secure online system. By transitioning from manual processes to digital tracking, the system not only reduced paper consumption but also enhanced accuracy and efficiency. Teachers could log in to the platform, view their class lists, and quickly mark students as present or absent. The system securely stored all data in a MySQL database, ensuring that attendance records were easily accessible and properly maintained.
